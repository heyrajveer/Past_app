Paste App - React + Vite + Tailwind CSS Template
This Paste App is a React-based application built using Vite and styled with Tailwind CSS. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on notes. The app lets you add, paste, and copy notes, all of which are stored in the browser's local storage for persistence.

Features
Vite: Fast development and optimized build tooling.
React: For building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for fast styling.
CRUD Operations: Users can create, read, update, and delete notes.
Local Storage: All notes are stored in the browser's local storage, ensuring data persistence even after page reloads.
React Router DOM: For routing and navigation between pages.
React Hot Toast: Elegant notifications to inform users of actions.
How It Works
Create: Add a new note or paste content into the app.
Read: View your saved notes, which are displayed in the app interface.
Update: Edit or update existing notes as needed.
Delete: Remove notes that are no longer needed.
Copy: Copy note content to the clipboard for external use.
Local Storage: Notes are saved in the browser's local storage, so they persist even after closing and reopening the browser.
Getting Started
